# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Driver and Navigator. Navigator brainstorms and understands what needs to be done, guides the driver while describing code. The driver is in charge of writing the code that the navigator describes, does the physical work of coding.

Researched answer: The driver focuses on the specifics of coding, while the navigator checks the work, code quality and provides direction. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A “higher-order function” is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.

2. Jest: Jest is a framework for ‘delightful JavaScript testing.’ It is built on top of Jasmine and is a popular testing framework specifically built to perform mainly unit testing of React and React Native applications.

3. Objects: An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.

4. Method: A set of instructions that are associated with an object.

5. Classes: Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
